- In digital world it's important choosing an username, should be something appropiate and respectfull and should not be an easy target for cybercrimes.
  - Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
  - Don’t use your email username.
  - Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
  - Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
  - Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters or the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
  - Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.
